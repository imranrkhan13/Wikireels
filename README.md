## How It Works

The app queries Wikipedia for interesting niche topics, retrieves summaries, and displays them in an elegant card-based interface. Each card features:
- Article title and summary (300-400 words)
- Beautiful dark-themed design with subtle color variations
- Floating decorative elements for visual depth
- One-tap access to the full Wikipedia article

Scroll vertically to discover new articles. The app automatically loads more content as you reach the end of the current batch.

## Design Philosophy

WikiReels transforms the traditional Wikipedia browsing experience into something more engaging and discovery-focused. Instead of searching for specific topics, users can endlessly scroll through curated interesting articles, making learning feel more like entertainment.
