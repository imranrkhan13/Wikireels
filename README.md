# WikiReels

Hey! 👋 I’m still working on WikiReels, but the idea is simple: scroll through bite-sized Wikipedia articles on the weirdest, most obscure topics you didn’t know existed.

From forgotten medieval weapons to bizarre experiments, each card will give you a quick peek—and eventually, you’ll be able to tap to read the full article.

Still a work in progress, but the goal is endless scrolling, cool animations, and a little trip through history’s weird corners. Stay tuned!
